# SunChain — Decentralized Solar Energy Network on Solana

**SunChain** is a **DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network)** that connects community solar hubs across Africa — starting from **South Africa** — using the **Solana blockchain** for energy data transparency, payments, and community ownership.


## Project Overview

SunChain enables communities to produce, share, and sell solar energy through decentralized smart contracts.  
Each solar hub is equipped with IoT meters that record generation and usage data directly on-chain.  
Payments and revenue distribution happen via Solana stablecoin transactions, ensuring transparency and trust.



## Core Features

**On-Chain Energy Data** — Real-time tracking of energy production and consumption.  
**Decentralized Payments** — Automatic, tamper-proof settlements via Solana smart contracts.  
**Transparent Revenue Sharing** — Local operators and investors get fair and verifiable payouts.   **DePIN Model** — Combines physical infrastructure (solar) with Web3 incentives.  
**IoT + Blockchain Integration** — Secure data flow from devices to Solana ledger.

## 🧠 Why Solana

- Ultra-fast, low-cost microtransactions for daily energy use.  
- High scalability for thousands of users per community.  
- Seamless connection to DePIN and IoT networks.

## Architecture Overview

1. **IoT Layer:** Smart meters collect solar data.  
2. **Blockchain Layer:** Data is verified and stored on Solana.  
3. **Payment Layer:** Users pay for energy via stablecoins.  
4. **Frontend Dashboard:** Real-time monitoring and analytics.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain:** Solana  
- **Smart Contracts:** Rust / Anchor Framework  
- **Frontend:** Next.js + TypeScript  
- **IoT Layer:** ESP32 + MQTT Broker + Solana RPC integration  
- **Database (off-chain):** Supabase / IPFS (for metadata)

## Security & Audit

SunChain uses:
- Multi-signature access control  
- Verified IoT data signatures  
- Escrow contracts for payments  
A **professional security audit** is planned before the mainnet launch to ensure safety and scalability.
